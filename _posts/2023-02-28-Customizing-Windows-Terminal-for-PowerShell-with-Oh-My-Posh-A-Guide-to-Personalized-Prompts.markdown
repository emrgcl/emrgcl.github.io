One way to make the terminal more user-friendly is by using Oh My Posh, which is a theme engine for PowerShell that provides a sleek and customizable prompt. By integrating **[Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/)** into Windows Terminal, users can enhance their PowerShell experience and make it more efficient and visually appealing. In this guide, we will explore how to install and use Oh My Posh in Windows Terminal to create a personalized prompt that suits your style and workflow.

It is pretty well documented in **[Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/)**  and there is a great youtuebe video by Adam **[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL9Mr4dzIWU)** - (only five minutes to watch) but if you want to jump in , install and configure right away here is how...

    ```
    winget install JanDeDobbeleer.OhMyPosh -s winget
    ```

We are half way thru...Time to configure.

## Lets configure now!
1. ***Pick yourself a template!***: 'Oh My Posh' has builtin templates they are under the envirornment path POSH_THEMES_PATH. You can check in PowerShell using below.
    ```
        gci $env:POSH_THEMES_PATH
    ```

    The visuals of these themes can be found [here](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/themes). Have a look at them and note the name. I liked the Unicorn one but the default theme had ðŸ¦„ in the prompt, which is attractive for my daughter but not me.  Dont worry we will change it as a customization example. For now lets remember we picked the unicorn!.

1. ***Optional Step! Modify the theme:*** Lets change the Unicorn (ðŸ¦„ ) to Fox (ðŸ¦Š) 
    - make a copy of the existing unicorn template. 
        ```
        copy-item -Path "$($Env:POSH_THEMES_PATH)\unicorn.omp.json" -Destination "$($Env:POSH_THEMES_PATH)\mytheme.omp.json"
        ```

    - Edit the template using vscode
        
        ```
        code "$($Env:POSH_THEMES_PATH)\mytheme.omp.json"
        ```
    - Around line 80s you will see the json snippet like below.
        ```
        {
          "foreground": "#f1184c",
          "style": "plain",
          "template": "ðŸ¦„ ",
          "type": "text"
        }
        ```
    - Change the emoji unicorn by pressing Win + .
        ![Fox Emoji]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/23-02-28-Customizing-Windows-Terminal-for-PowerShell-with-Oh-My-Posh-A-Guide-to-Personalized-Prompts/foxemoji.png)
    - Save the file.
1. ***Change the default font of Terminal:*** Open Windows terminal. `In Settings / Profile / Defaults / Appearance / Text` change `Font Face` to 'Hack Nerd Font' the one we installed.
        ![NerdFont]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/23-02-28-Customizing-Windows-Terminal-for-PowerShell-with-Oh-My-Posh-A-Guide-to-Personalized-Prompts/nerd.png)
1. ***Change the font in Vscode***: Vscode terminal requires  Mono fonts, luckily the hack nerd has one.
    - open Vscode
    - Hit F1 to open command pallete.
    - type `Preferences: Open User Settings(Json)` and open preferences
    - add the below line to the end of the settings. 
        ![VscodeFont]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/23-02-28-Customizing-Windows-Terminal-for-PowerShell-with-Oh-My-Posh-A-Guide-to-Personalized-Prompts/terminalfont.png)
1. ***Final Step! lets configure PowerShell profile to enable OH My Posh:*** we need to one line to initialize the prompt as soon as the PowersHell starts. We will use the allusersAllHosts Profile to reflect the change for both Terminal and Vscode Terminal. Plese note if you have PowerShell 7 you will need to change the profile of Powershell 7 as well the steps are the same.
    - Edit the profile profile by running below command
      ```
      code $PROFILE.AllUsersAllHosts
      ```
    - Add the following line the file and save. Please dont forget the theme name to the desired one. We modified in this post our tempalte and saved into mytheme.omp.json
        ```
        oh-my-posh init pwsh --config "$($Env:POSH_THEMES_PATH)\mytheme.omp.json" | Invoke-Expression
        ```
1. Restart Windows Terminal and Visual Code and Enjoy!
