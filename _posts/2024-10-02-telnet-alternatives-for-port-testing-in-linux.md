# Telnet Alternatives for Port Testing in Linux

Late one evening, I found myself staring at the terminal, faced with a daunting task: testing ports on a remote server. But there was a catch—`telnet` was no longer installed, and I wasn't eager to bring back the old tool. That's when I discovered a set of modern alternatives that changed the way I approach port testing forever. Here are the tools that saved the day.

If you want to test ports in Linux without using the deprecated `telnet` command, here are some great alternatives:

## 1. Netcat (`nc`)
`netcat` (or `nc`) is a versatile tool that can test connections on specific ports.

### Usage:
{% highlight bash %}
nc -zv <hostname or IP> <port>
{% endhighlight %}
- The `-z` option is for scanning without sending data.
- The `-v` option enables verbose output.

#### Example:
{% highlight bash %}
nc -zv google.com 80
{% endhighlight %}

## 2. Nmap
`nmap` is a powerful network scanning tool that can test whether a specific port is open.

### Usage:
{% highlight bash %}
nmap -p <port> <hostname or IP>
{% endhighlight %}

#### Example:
{% highlight bash %}
nmap -p 80 google.com
{% endhighlight %}

## 3. Curl
`curl` is typically used for transferring data but can also test connections to ports (especially HTTP/S).

### Usage:
{% highlight bash %}
curl -v telnet://<hostname or IP>:<port>
{% endhighlight %}

#### Example:
{% highlight bash %}
curl -v telnet://google.com:80
{% endhighlight %}

## 4. OpenSSL (`openssl s_client`)
`openssl` is useful for testing SSL/TLS connections to a port.

### Usage:
{% highlight bash %}
openssl s_client -connect <hostname or IP>:<port>
{% endhighlight %}

#### Example:
{% highlight bash %}
openssl s_client -connect google.com:443
{% endhighlight %}

## 5. Socat
`socat` is another versatile networking tool, similar to `nc` but with more advanced features.

### Usage:
{% highlight bash %}
socat - TCP:<hostname or IP>:<port>
{% endhighlight %}

#### Example:
{% highlight bash %}
socat - TCP:google.com:80
{% endhighlight %}

## 6. Bash `/dev/tcp`
Bash itself can be used to test ports by accessing `/dev/tcp`.

### Usage:
{% highlight bash %}
echo > /dev/tcp/<hostname or IP>/<port> && echo "Port is open" || echo "Port is closed"
{% endhighlight %}

#### Example:
{% highlight bash %}
echo > /dev/tcp/google.com/80 && echo "Port is open" || echo "Port is closed"
{% endhighlight %}
