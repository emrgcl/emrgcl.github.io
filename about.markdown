# About Me  

Hi, I’m **Emre** 👋  

I’m a **Senior Cloud Solution Architect** with over 30 years of experience working across enterprise IT, cloud platforms, and software development. Over the years, I’ve helped organizations design, build, and operate secure, scalable, and well-architected environments—spanning on-premises datacenters, hybrid scenarios, and the Microsoft Azure cloud.  

This blog is my place to share **hands-on technical articles, deep dives, and lessons learned** from real projects. You’ll find content on topics like:  

- **Cloud Architecture & Infrastructure** (Azure, networking, hybrid connectivity, security)  
- **Monitoring & Automation** (Log Analytics, KQL, PowerShell, Terraform, DevOps pipelines)  
- **Software Development & Tools** (C#, .NET, Go, containerization, WPF, modern workflows)  
- **Best Practices & Design Patterns** drawn from real customer engagements and field experience  

My writing is practical, focused on solving real-world challenges rather than repeating documentation. Whether you’re an engineer, architect, or just curious about modern IT practices, I hope you’ll find something here that saves you time, sparks an idea, or gives you a new perspective.

## Beyond Work  

Outside of my professional life, I’m passionate about:  

- 🚐 **Caravanning** — exploring the road with my VW California and Fendt trailer  
- 🌊 **Windsurfing** — always chasing the wind and looking for the next challenge on the water  
- 📸 **Photography** — capturing landscapes, city life, and memorable moments  
- 🎶 **Music** — both listening and discovering new inspiration
